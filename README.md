# 3D Model parameterized generated from ANSYS  SpaceClaim
This project aims to build a series 3D CAD/CAE model by script. We had use the iso2mesh which developed by Prof. Qianqian Fang [see here](https://iso2mesh.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/index.cgi/), but it can not generated a suitable models for finite method.  While there are other excellent software such as 3DSMAX or ABQUS, we have chosen ANSYS due to licensing restrictions.
## How to use
- Open SpaceClaim
- choose "Design"
- choose "Script"
- Import the program you wanted
